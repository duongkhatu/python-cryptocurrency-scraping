# Cryptocurrency Data Scraper
This is a Python project in which I write a script that would automatically scrape data of three chosen cryptocurrencies and clean it, then save the cleaned data as a csv file. The script is scheduled to execute at regular intervals. It is a part of our Python for Beginner Challenge held by the Mentor and Supporters of the Self-study Data Discord community, with support from Sir Alex Freberg (CEO of Analyst Builder).

I have also included a sample result csv file for reference (*crypto_scraped_data.csv*). The data in this function is scraped every 10 seconds for convenient test run, but the interval can be set to be longer in a real use case.

**The requirements for this project are as follows:**  
Write Python code to automatically scrape all the information for Bitcoin. The minimum requirements should include the currency's name, its price and the timestamp when the data was pulled.

How bonus points are given:
- 1 point: Meet the minimum requirements.
- 3 points: Retrieve all Bitcoin information, including price, 1h %, 24h %, 7d %, market cap, and 24h volume.
- 6 points: Gather the same information as in point 3 for three different cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB.
